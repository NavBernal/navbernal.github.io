    <h1>CSC 196W: Assignment 2</h1>
    <p>Currently, I find iOS development using <strong>SwiftUI.</strong>
        While Xcode kind of blows, Swift is a pretty beginner
        friendly language to learn. As my <strong>senior project</strong> involves
        creating a working app for <strong>iOS devices</strong>, there is no better
        time than ever to begin learning more about SwiftUI which
        I have decided to do by making a simple <strong>card-matching
        game.</strong> Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/NavBernal/MemorizeApp"
